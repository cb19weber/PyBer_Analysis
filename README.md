# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Week five of the Data Analytics bootcamp provided the opportunity to work with a new python library: Matplotlib. Additionally, the project will require continued building on skill development using the Pandas library and jupyter notebook, as well as offer an introduction to the SciPy and NumPy libraries. The goal of the week is to begin building some greater muscle memory with the basic syntax of the language as well as to harness Matplotlib to design and publish rich visualizations to communicate the story of the underlying data.
