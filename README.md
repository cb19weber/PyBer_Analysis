# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Week five of the Data Analytics bootcamp provided the opportunity to work with a new python library: Matplotlib. Additionally, the project will require continued building on skill development using the Pandas library and jupyter notebook, as well as offer an introduction to the SciPy and NumPy libraries. The goal of the week is to begin building some greater muscle memory with the basic syntax of the language as well as to harness Matplotlib to design and publish rich visualizations to communicate the story of the underlying data.

### Purpose
The specific purpose of the project in this module is to examine a dataset for ride-sharing services to determine how to improve access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The project will require importing the datasets into a Pandas DataFrame, using Pandas to merge and summarize the datasets, and then implement Matplotlib to build a few visualizations that effectively communicate the story of the data. Telling that story will require the use of NumPy to obtain statistical descriptions of the data, and then to use the stats to build furhter visualizations that flesh out some of the nuances within the data.
